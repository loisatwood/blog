            why static sites are not old hat

so, back in october, Netflix reported a:

> 50% reduction in [their] time to interactive (TTI) metric
>> https://twitter.com/NetflixUIE/status/923374215041912833

which when unpacked basically means the web page loaded 50% faster.

They said they achieved this by:

> Removing client-side React.js (but keeping it on the server)

which, when expanded upon, basically equates to rendering static pages server-side while retaining node.js and react for real-time updates to pages.

In other words, client-side JS slows things down while static HTML is pretty nimble. I believe the most appropriate reply would be "no shit, Sherlock".

Now, I don't want to piss on anyone's bonfire here, but this goes to prove one of my mentors and friends absolutely right about something he's been telling me since I got started in this line of work: client-side JS is greatly abused and unnecessary in the majority of cases in which it rears its ugly head. this comes from a guy who loves javascript and has been working with it since it was called DHTML.

I was sceptical when he first told me these things. I felt like he was a luddite, or disliked the complexity that javascript libraries introduce (hello angular i'm looking at you). I thought maybe be doesn't like all the command line eco-systems and build processes that these libraries implicitly necessitate, since the guy knows plain javascript like the back of his hand and doesn't like preprocessors for CSS.

and yet, after having worked on some of my own projects, and after experiencing first-hand how slow some websites are steadily becoming, i can't help but agree that web development is becoming a bloated mess. it's not even a question of there being too many javascript libraries to choose from or obsolescence of said libraries -- there's a lot of chatter that almost all javascript libraries seem to become obsolete after only a few years, but I don't think this is quite true, given the number of suggestions to work on angular projects I get in my inbox every week (which I promptly bin, because screw that shit, sorry indeed.co.uk).

no, the problem isn't the churn, it's the fact that hours, days, weeks, months sink into constructing websites with these libraries, and then you visit a competitor whose website is a little older, and yet you think "hey, this is nicer to use" or "wow this is fast". newer websites are slower than the old ones! and they're surprisingly inconsistent! sometimes, for instance, if I open the BBC homepage or some other js heavy website, I see blank squares where images should be. I check the browser tab and it seems to have stopped loading. I check the console, it reports that some javascript module wasn't loaded correctly or 404'd. I refresh and the images appear. that's fine, I'm going to refresh because I want to see the news, but that kind of bullshit might sway someone as yet undecided on whether they want to become a regular visitor to the bbc website. if it was an e-commerce site, can't say i'd prioritise revisiting compared to a website where the images load properly.

and this boils down to the reason why, despite using complex and comprehensive client-side form validation libraries, we always do a full validation of form data server-side as well: client-side interaction is unreliable and unpredictable. disregarding for a moment the fact that client js validation can be tampered with by the submitter of the form, if the validation library failed to load, people can suddenly submit anything they want. if they use a plugin to block javascript, they can submit anything they want. and I think a great number of people do actually browse with javascript switched off, it's not just paranoid people. maybe I'm biased, because I'm a web developer and I'd say 50% of other web developers I know switch javascript off on their mobile device's web browser. for us, we have to deal with the fact that some websites just aren't usable on a mobile as a result, but that's the point: we switched javascript off because they were already unusable.

I treat with scepticism a lot of these claims about how the "days of the desktop browser are at an end" -- I use my browser when I'm off the clock and relaxing at home. it's a bigger screen, things are more likely to work in real firefox or real chrome than they are in some kind of bastardised mobile version, and unlike mobile browsers, the desktop browser can't shove adverts in my face. i can also use a real keyboard if I use my laptop to browse things, and I don't have to zoom in on half the things I want to look at, so I don't think the desktop is in any great decline. sure, lots of people browse on the move now, during commutes or on lunch breaks at cafes etc.

and while i don't think the desktop is going anywhere, I do recognise the importance of having websites work on mobile devices, because it includes tablets. I love my ipad and I use it a lot (albeit with a physical keyboard). yet because I'm stuck using safari (alternatives are just reskins of the same webview api, no point using them) I find that many websites either don't work or are ... a bit off. I'm not talking about design, most websites have got responsive web design now (to varying degrees of success) but sometimes the sites feel slower in safari, presumably because some things are poorly optimised in safari's webkit/nitro engine compared to blink/v8. obviously sometimes the converse can be true, i've seen benchmarks where safari is one of the fastest, but i've also seen benchmarks where internet explorer edge is the fastest -- and that's really not likely to be true for the majority of real-world cases, since edge is broken garbage (sorry... but... it is. I mean the UI is horrendous as well pls fix)

all of these problems are solved if you just make your website usable without necessitating javascript. websites shouldn't be apps unless they are apps or games. games, sure, no point trying to make that shit work with only CSS (though it is possible for simple games, and given some of the shit I've seen, it's probably possible to make complex games with CSS using radio inputs and adjacent selectors, though it would probably take 20 years and the entire game and all branches of its story would have to be planned out and known from day 1). websites should be websites, i.e. documents. HTML documents with CSS to make them pretty. let's face it, what does all of this javascript do? in the case of a website which has been built as an app, you basically have a way of justifying your web developers' salaries and time-to-completion estimates. because the startup hired some "top talent" (read: expensive talent) who settled into their roles and secured their future at the company by making sure their work would be as complex as possible without it being impossible to maintain for themselves or others of their kind.

if we built websites as HTML documents with progressive ajax enhancement where it is beneficial to the user to use ajax (in terms of UX) we'd actually be making life better for the customer, at the cost of our own ergonomics and dev-ops. ironically, this is demonstrative of something that gets whispered on forums occasionally: all of this dev-ops stuff is about managerial accountability and being able to prove you're working, and it's also about keeping a job over time. if we made websites to suit users, we'd be sacrificing a bit of ease of maintenance on our side (arguably) but more importantly we'd have less to say in meetings, fewer charts to show in meetings, less jargon and bullshit to feed to managers from other departments, less jargon/bullshit to attract the next generation of developers to our cause, and we'd also be out of a job as soon as the website was functional because it woudn't need to be fixed every two days. it would just work with a little maintenance here and there.

look at companies like pinboard. it is run by one guy, and while it's obviously pretty straightforward as services go, it's also an example of how simple many platforms could be if they were made with the user in mind and not the developers. even in cases where developers are not trying to justify their existence or feed nonsense to inquisitorial managers, they are just feeding their own egos or ids by doing purely what empowers or pleases them (respectively -- yeah I'm using freudian terms, sue me).

the humble static site is ready to make a comeback. it already has for a lot of companies who understand that they just need an online business card to entice new customers, i.e. whose service isn't purely online, but static is also ready to make a comeback for e-commerce and other app-ish website types. because where have we found ourselves now? we're currently at "using javascript to emit html on the server" which is only one word different to "using perl to emit html on the server", and that's where we were 20 years ago. something has gone wrong somewhere down the line. CSS empowered developers to craft beautiful websites without using javascript to govern the sizing of objects at all, and yet javascript is found in the form of jquery libraries to make sure grids align. we have flexbox and hell even inline-block based grid systems could do this, years ago, without javascript involvement at all.

maybe jquery libraries are a bigger part of the problem than all of this developer churn mentioned before. maybe the barrier to entry for web development is so low now that we're getting a lot of shitty websites, but a lot of the worst experiences (that are actually experiences and not just fake websites with a million adverts and clickbait titles that manage to get to google's "carefully curated" first page...) are actually coming from the big brands and tech companies who should be hiring better and putting it to their developers that they need to focus on the ergonomics of the user. a glance at some repositories on github simply alarms me. there are comments about the provability of javascript libraries used for websites. provability. for haskell/fortran programs used by goldman sachs, I get it. for a library to load my cart asynchronously, come on. are you serious.

it's nice in principle, maybe I'm overreacting. it's not like i'm threatened by this. my school didn't have a great IT department or program but I'm confident I can teach myself by following in the footsteps of my betters. it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth to see so much complexity being introduced into something which can still be so easy with static site generators becoming really advanced now.

maybe there are more people who feel the same way, I just don't know. feel free to throw a comment and let me know if I'm truly alone and naive for thinking this way. I don't like feeling like I'm out of touch at the beginning of my career, but better to be out of touch now that I have time to fix it, than later when I do not. but from where I'm standing, I can't see how things like intercooler.js on a static website aren't the norm for basic web development.
